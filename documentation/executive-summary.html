<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Thatswhatcheesesaid.io will be a website for Mac and Cheese lovers to submit/rank local restaurants' Mac and Cheese dishes
    and submit photos of their own Mac and Cheese creations to be voted on and ranked. The website will rely heavily on
    user submitted data. Users will have two options for the restaurant ranking, "upfork" and "downfork". Restaurants
    will be ranked based on the difference between upforks and downforks. Submitted photos will also be displayed side
    by side randomly for the website user to pick which photo looks the "cheesiest". The top 5 cheesiest photos will be
    displayed on the front page. Rankings will be updated periodically. </p>
