    <p>As a power voter user, I want to upload and vote on multiple photos.</p>
    <h2>Use Case</h2>
    <p>Steven is trying his hand at something new: being a person on the internet. Not just any person, but the next
        YouTube Chef Sensation! Being trained in a commercial kitchen already, he knew this was something he could
        dominate. His specialty: Mac and Cheese. His social media profiles are doing okay but he wants that competitive
        feeling he had with the staff at the various restaurants he worked before. Steven discovers That's What Cheese
        Said, a website dedicated to ranking Mac and Cheese dishes from restaurants in the area and from user submissions.
